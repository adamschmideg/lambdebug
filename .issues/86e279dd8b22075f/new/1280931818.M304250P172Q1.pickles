Subject: Trace loop-recur
Message-Id: <86e279dd8b22075f-0-artemis@pickles>

Tracing a loop now moves recur out of its tail position, resulting in a
compilation error.  Possible solutions,
 - Detect recur in forms, and don't trace along the path leading to it
 - Have a trace-recur function that has to be called explicitly
